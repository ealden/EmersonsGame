Feature: Racer

  Scenario Outline: Race
    Given I am in a race
    And   I am at position <Position>
    And   I have damage of <Damage>
    When  I choose "<Speed>" speed
    And   I roll a <Roll>
    Then  I must now be at position <New Position>
    And   I must now have damage of <New Damage>
    And   I must see the race result: "<Result>"

    Examples: NORMAL speed is move 1 for odd roll, 2 for even roll

      | Position  | Damage  | Speed   | Roll  | New Position  | New Damage  | Result  |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 1     | 1             | 0           | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 2     | 2             | 0           | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 3     | 1             | 0           | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | NORMAL  | 4     | 2             | 0           | --      |

    Examples: SUPER speed is move based on roll but take 1 damage every time we roll

      | Position  | Damage  | Speed   | Roll  | New Position  | New Damage  | Result  |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 1     | 1             | 1           | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 2     | 2             | 1           | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 3     | 3             | 1           | --      |
      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 4     | 4             | 1           | --      |

      | 0         | 0       | SUPER   | 6     | 6             | 1           | --      |

    Examples: Damage is deducted from each roll

      | Position  | Damage  | Speed   | Roll  | New Position  | New Damage  | Result  |
